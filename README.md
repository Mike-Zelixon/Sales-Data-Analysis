# Sales-Data-Analysis

Exploratory data analysis (EDA) of sales data using Python & Jupyter Notebook.

Explores topics that any business would ask themselves with a data deep dive on how to improve sales and which other areas might need to be improved upon.

Libraries that were used include Pandas and Matplotlib. 

Huge thanks to Keith Galli for the inspiration and instructions!!!
