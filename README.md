# Sales-Data-Analysis

Exploratory data analysis (EDA) of sales data using Python & Jupyter Notebook.

Explores topics that a business would ask with a data deep dive on how to improve sales and which areas need to be improved upon.

Libraries that were used include Pandas and Matplotlib. 

Huge thanks to Keith Galli for the inspiration and instructions!
